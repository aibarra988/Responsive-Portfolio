                    My name is Abraham Ibarra. I am from El Paso, TX and 
                    I've been living in Austin since 2012. Some of my 
                    favorite hobbies are tinkering with technology, 
                    skateboarding, and cooking. I love going to shows in 
                    town and traveling to national parks across the US. <br><br>
    
                    As far as I can remember, I've been fascinated by 
                    computers, video games and problem solving. I knew my calling
                    was to be a developer. After 
                    serving in the US Navy for four years, I've gained five 
                    years in the IT industry; three of which I have been a 
                    software developer at CA Technologies working on the IDaaS 
                    platform CA Identity Service. <br><br>
    
                    During my time at CA Technologies, I was left hungry to keep 
                    growing as a software engineer. My goal
                    is to always keep working towards writing clean and useful code 
                    while keeping in mind the hardships and lessons that come from working on 
                    a dense codebase with brittle tests. One big lesson I learned: always write
                    tests. <br><br>
                    
                    I enjoyed being able to contribute 
                    to working in all of the components of our tech stack and 
                    participate in designing and developing new features.
                    I made the time to sharpen my skills and grow my network 
                    by going to The Coding Boot Camp at the University of Texas 
                    so that I could feel more confident when interviewing for 
                    my next position.
